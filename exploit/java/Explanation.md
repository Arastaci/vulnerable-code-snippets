### Explanation
The application is monolithic and uses server-side rendering.
It fetches user comments from the backend, as we can see on line 7.
On line 9, it appears that the backend is encoding certain characters: `<` becomes `&lt;`, and `>` becomes `&gt;`.

The issue arises on line 10. While the context provided by the backend seems safe, the encoded data is passed to the Normalizer class after encoding. Essentially, the already-encoded data gets decoded. This results in the unwanted behavior of decoding the characters that should have remained encoded.

The Normalizer class likely normalizes Unicode characters, as the backend normalizes smaller or larger characters. Given this, it's reasonable to assume that the normalizer could be normalizing Unicode characters as well.

As a result, it's highly likely that a Unicode-based XSS payload will work here. For example:  
```bash
{'comment':'\ufe64script\ufe65alert(document.domain);\ufe64/script\ufe65'}
```
