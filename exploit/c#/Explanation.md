### Explanation
Let's analyze the regex on line 5 using [https://regex101.com](https://regex101.com).
There are two possible solutions for this issue:

1. **TLD Manipulation**:
 We can manipulate the TLD on line 8. For example, if we provide `puter`, the TLD changes to `com'puter`, which allows us to redirect to a different domain.
    
    A list of TLDs can be found here: [https://tld-list.com/tlds-from-a-z](https://tld-list.com/tlds-from-a-z)
    - .community
    - .company
    - .computer
    
     Payload: `puter` 

2. **Subdomain Manipulation**:
    The URL must include a `/` after `.com`. However, by providing a subdomain such as `https://api.github.com.hacker.com`, we can inject our own subdomain by setting the path parameter to something like `.hacker.com`.

    Payload: `.hacker.com/hello`
