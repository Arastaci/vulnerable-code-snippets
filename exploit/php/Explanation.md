Path: `/examples/insecure/php/WeakCryptography.php`

### Explanation

At first glance, you might expect a classic SQL Injection vulnerability, but there is no SQLi on line 8. However, if you examine line 27, you will notice a vulnerability where the server-generated token can be predicted. This involves the `changePassword` and `generatePasswordResetToken` functions. These functions are responsible for generating tokens, but they fail to use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).

For secure token generation, it is essential to use a cryptographically secure random generator. If the server generates a token at time T, it must use a secure method to ensure the token cannot be predicted.

The server's time can be retrieved via a simple curl request, such as:
```bash
curl https://example.com/ --head
```
While the server's time and the local time obtained with the `date` command are not necessarily synchronized, the server's time can still be a critical factor for an attacker.

### Attack Vector
Suppose you are targeting a specific user, e.g., `victim@gmail.com`. To exploit this vulnerability, you can force the system to generate a token for that user (e.g., via email or SMS). By analyzing the server's behavior and predicting the generated token, you may potentially bypass authentication or perform other malicious actions.

### Note
The use of MD5 alone does not inherently make a system insecure.
