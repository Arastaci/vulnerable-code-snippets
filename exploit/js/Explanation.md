## [CaseInsensitive.js](../../examples/insecure/js/CaseInsensitive.js)
Path: `/examples/insecure/js/CaseInsensitive.js`

### Explanation
The issue arises because the `startsWith` method is **not case-sensitive**. This means that requests like `/api` or `/ApI` can bypass authentication checks. 

The vulnerability is introduced on line 6:  
- If the path starts with `/api`, an authentication check is performed (line 7).  
- However, if the path does not start with `/api`, the code skips authentication and moves directly to the `next` function (line 13).  
- If a payload like `target.com/./ApI` is provided:  
1. The `next` function normalizes the path.  
2. Since there is no self-loop or further validation, the request bypasses all authentication and is processed without any checks.
